A Novel Optimized Approach for Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Employee Attrition
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10084237
All firms increasingly view employee attrition as a major problem because of its negative impact on workplace productivity and the timely achievement of corporate goals and vision. Businesses are using machine learning technology to estimate worker turnover rates in an effort to solve this problem. In order to most precisely anticipate employee attrition, various machine learning algorithms are investigated and their results are compared in this study. The study also optimizes the results of the most efficient machine learning algorithm for the given data using the ROC method. Notably, optimization of machine learning algorithms has not been studied in earlier research works related to employee attrition. In the current study, an attempt is made to optimize the performance of the selected algorithm and a model is proposed
